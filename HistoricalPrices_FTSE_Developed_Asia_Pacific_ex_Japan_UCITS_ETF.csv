"This document is directed at professional investors only and should not be distributed to or relied upon by retail investors. The material contained in this document is not to be regarded as an offer to buy or sell or the solicitation of any offer to buy or sell securities in any jurisdiction where such an offer or solicitation is against the law, or to anyone to whom it is unlawful to make such an offer or solicitation, or if the person making the offer or solicitation is not qualified to do so. The information on this document does not constitute legal, tax, or investment advice. You must not, therefore, rely on the content of this document when making any investment decisions.The value of investments, and the income from them, may fall or rise and investors may get back less than they invested. The value of investments may fall or rise as a result of changes in exchange rates. Some funds may invest in emerging markets which can be more volatile than more established markets. As a result the value of this investment may rise or fall. Corporate bonds may provide higher yields but as such may carry greater credit risk increasing the risk of default on repayment and erosion of the capital value of your investment and the level of income may fluctuate. Fixed interest securities also carry the risk of default on repayment and erosion of the capital value of your investment and the level of income may fluctuate. Movements in interest rates are likely to affect the capital value of fixed interest securities. Investments in smaller companies may be more volatile than investments in well-established blue chip companies.Some funds may invest in derivatives. For the FTSE U.K. Equity Income Index Fund Charges are deducted from capital (not income). Whilst this may increase the level of income paid, it will result in capital erosion and will constrain growth.
